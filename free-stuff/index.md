### E-bike discounts

If you're buying an e-bike online, you can often save at least $50 using
a referral code. You can get a code from a friend or use one of ours.
If you use ours, we'll pass any credit we get to another local e-bike buyer.
Many brands have referral codes, so if you're going to buy an e-bike
from a company not listed here, [let us
know](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) and we'll set up referrals.

* KBO: http://kbobike.refr.cc/charlottesvilleebike
* Propella: https://www.propellasg.com/?r=usr_2HpyAnASNiIIcYTVEiIFqIdLZKE

If an e-bike is outside your budget, [let us
know](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) and we'll send you a referral
credit for your preferred brand if we have any available.

### Extra stuff

### Anti-theft stickers

We also have a bunch of stickers from [Bike
Index](https://bikeindex.org/). You can put a sticker on your bike and
register it with Bike Index. If your bike gets stolen, you can notify
Bike Index, and potential buyers will be able to figure out that the
bike was stolen and should be returned to you. [Let us
know](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) if you want some stickers!
