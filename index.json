[{"categories":null,"content":"About E-bikes are a great way to replace short car trips. But most affordable e-bikes are sold online, so it‚Äôs not always easy to try an e-bike before you buy one. The Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library is a free service that lends out e-bikes for up to a week so you can try an e-bike (or a few) and decide whether you want to get one yourself. Sign up to borrow an e-bike or contact us with any questions.

We‚Äôll provide a lock and show you how to use it. We also use a tracker to help prevent the e-bikes from being stolen. You should be comfortable riding a standard bicycle and familiar with local bicycling rules. If you‚Äôre planning to commute on the e-bike, you should map out a route that you‚Äôll feel safe on. If you need help choosing a route, let us know! E-bikes are generally heavier than standard bikes, and ours weigh between 45 and 75 lb. If you‚Äôll need to carry an e-bike up or down stairs, you might want to try one of our ligher e-bikes.
