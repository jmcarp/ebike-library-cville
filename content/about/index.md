# About

E-bikes are a great way to replace short car trips. But most affordable
e-bikes are sold online, so it's not always easy to try an e-bike before
you buy one. The Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library is a free
service that lends out e-bikes for up to a week so you can try an e-bike
(or a few) and decide whether you want to get one yourself. [Sign
up](https://forms.gle/ZykVSUUp2KPBHxfv5) to borrow an e-bike or [contact
us](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) with any questions.

### Eligibility

* We really don't want our e-bikes to get stolen, so you should be able
    to store one indoors at home, and have a secure place to lock it up
    if you’re commuting to work or to school. We'll provide a lock and
    show you how to use it. We also use a tracker to help prevent the
    e-bikes from being stolen.
* You should be comfortable riding a standard bicycle and familiar with
    local bicycling rules. If you're planning to commute on the e-bike,
    you should map out a route that you’ll feel safe on. If you need
    help choosing a route, [let us
    know](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org)!
* E-bikes are generally heavier than standard bikes, and ours weigh
    between 45 and 75 lb. If you'll need to carry an e-bike up or down
    stairs, you might want to try one of our ligher e-bikes.
