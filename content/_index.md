# Curious about e-bikes? Try one from the Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library!

E-bikes are a great way to get around Charlottesville. But there are
many brands and styles to choose from, and because many e-bikes are sold
online, it can be a challenge to try an e-bike before buying one.

The Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library is a free, not-for-profit
service working to expand access to e-bikes in the area. We have a small
collection of e-bikes that we lend out to community members for up to a
week, for free. You can experience your daily commute, go grocery
shopping, or even bike your kids to school, and decide whether e-bikes
are right for you. [Sign up](https://forms.gle/ZykVSUUp2KPBHxfv5) to
borrow an e-bike or [contact us](hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) with any
questions.

### How it works

* Contact us to let us know which e-bike(s) you'd like to try.
* We'll get in touch to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike.
* Visit the library in Fifeville to pick up an e-bike. If you haven't
    ridden an e-bike before, expect this to take 15-30 minutes, or
    longer if you want to try more than one e-bike.
* Enjoy e-biking for up to a week, then bring the e-bike back to the
    library.
* You can borrow an e-bike more than once, or borrow multiple e-bikes.

To be eligible, you must be 18 or older, and have a secure place to
store an e-bike at home, and at work or school if you plan to commute.
You should also be comfortable riding a standard bicycle before trying
an e-bike.

The E-bike Library is run by me, Josh Carp, using my own e-bikes and
some e-bikes donated by friends and neighbors. The e-bikes are stored in
my laundry room and shed at my home in Fifeville:
