# Curious about e-bikes? Try one from the E-bike Lending Library!

Interested in buying an electric bike but not sure where to start? The Charlottesville
E-bike Lending Library is a local nonprofit that lends out e-bikes for up to a week to
help figure out whether an e-bike would be a good fit for you. Loans are free, but we
depend on [donations](/support) to help cover the costs of maintaining our fleet.

When you borrow a bike, you can experience your daily commute, go grocery shopping, or
even bike your kids to school, and decide whether e-bikes are right for you.
[Sign up](https://forms.gle/ZykVSUUp2KPBHxfv5) to borrow an e-bike or
[contact us](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) with any questions.

### How it works

- Contact us to let us know which e-bike(s) you'd like to try.
- We'll get in touch to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike.
- Visit the library in Fifeville to pick up an e-bike. Expect this to take 15-30 minutes,
  or longer if you want to try more than one e-bike.
- Enjoy e-biking for up to a week, then bring the e-bike back to the library.
- You can borrow an e-bike more than once, or borrow multiple e-bikes.

To be eligible, you must be 18 or older and have a secure place to store an e-bike at
home, and at work or school if you plan to commute. You should also be comfortable riding
a standard bicycle before trying an e-bike.

The E-bike Library is run by me, Josh Carp, using my own e-bikes and e-bikes donated by
friends and neighbors. The e-bikes are stored in my laundry room and shed at my home in
Fifeville:

The e-bikes are free to borrow, but we welcome [donations and volunteers](/support) if
you'd like to support our mission and help cover our costs.
