# Get your own e-bike

We don't sell e-bikes (or anything else), but we have some tips for finding your own
e-bike and taking care of it once it arrives.

### Choosing an e-bike

- Try one first. If possible, try the e-bike you want to buy before ordering one. If you
  can't try the specific model you want to buy, try an e-bike from the same company, or an
  e-bike of a similar style.
- Think about your use case. Are you getting an e-bike to commute to work? To carry
  groceries home from the store? To bike a kid to school? Different e-bike models work for
  different use cases. If you're planning on carrying cargo or kids, it might be worth
  springing for an e-bike with a high-capacity rear rack and high-quality brakes (we
  prefer hydraulic brakes for cargo).
- Read reviews. [Electric Bike Report](https://electricbikereport.com) and
  [Electric Bike Review](https://electricbikereview.com) have reviews of many popular
  brands and models. There's also a very active and friendly
  [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/ebikes), and Facebook groups for many popular e-bike
  makers. Of course, take anything you read online with a grain of salt.
- Make a plan for maintenance. Many bike shops in the Charlottesville area will do
  mechanical work on e-bikes, like adjusting your brakes or doing a tune-up. But they may
  not be able to work on the electronics in your e-bike. Ask a bike shop if they'll work
  on the e-bike you're considering.

### Where to buy an e-bike

- Local or online. Several local bike shops in the Charlottesville area sell e-bikes. You
  can also order an e-bike online from a growing number of companies. Prices are typically
  lower online, but keep in mind that you won't have to assemble a bike that you buy from
  a local shop, and you'll typically receive free or discounted maintenance if you buy
  locally.
- Budget bikes. You can find decent e-bikes for as little as $800, especially if you don't
  need high-end features. But do your homework before buying an e-bike from an e-commerce
  company like Amazon or Walmart. It may be difficult to find independent reviews for
  e-bikes sold on Amazon, and spare parts may be hard to come by. If you're looking for an
  affordable e-bike, we recommend starting with a guide like Electric Bike Review's
  [Best Cheap Electric Bikes](https://electricbikereport.com/best-cheap-electric-bikes).
- Look for discounts. Both local shops and online e-bike sellers tend to offer holiday
  sales, as well as discounts on older models. You can also

  like [Aventon](https://shop.id.me/stores/9973-aventon-bikes) and
  [Juiced](https://www.juicedbikes.com/pages/exclusive-discounts) also offer discounts to
  students, teachers, health care workers, or veterans.
- Consider a used e-bike. You can buy a used e-bike with a warranty from
  [Upway](https://upway.co), or check Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. You may find a
  lightly used e-bike for a better price than a new lower-end model.

### Once you get your e-bike

- Assemble your e-bike. Most e-bikes that you order online require some assembly. Read the
  assembly instructions and watch videos if available. If you don't want to assemble your
  e-bike on your own, most local bike shops will do it for you at a reasonable price. You
  may even be able to ship your bike directly to the shop.
- Check out your e-bike. If you assembled your e-bike on your own, consider taking it to a
  local bike shop within the first 100 miles of use. Your e-bike might need the brakes or
  derailleur adjusted. Most shops won't charge you for a full tune-up if the e-bike
  doesn't need much work.
- Take care of your e-bike. Your e-bike will need regular maintenance. If you enjoy
  working on bikes, you can do a lot of it yourself. For example, you can adjust your
  brakes with a hex key and a pair of pliers. E-bikes are heavier and faster than regular
  bikes, so your brakes may wear faster than the brakes on a regular bike.
- Ride safely. The Charlottesville area doesn't have great bike infrastructure, so you'll
  probably be sharing the road with cars. It's possible to get to almost anywhere within
  city limits, and many places in Albemarle County, on an e-bike, but it helps to plan
  your route in advance, and use side streets, parking lots, and maybe an occasional ride
  on the sidewalk to get away from traffic.
