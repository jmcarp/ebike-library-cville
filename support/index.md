# Support our mission

We don't charge to borrow an e-bike, but we welcome donations to help cover maintenance
and events. You can make a tax-deductible contribution
[via Virginia Organizing](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1388125) (select
Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library from the designation drop-down).

We also welcome volunteers who want to help get the word out about e-bikes, plan community
events, and advocate for better bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in the
Charlottesville area. Get in touch at hi@ebikelibrarycville.com if you'd like to get
involved!
