### Guidelines for borrowing an e-bike

- **Wear a helmet**. If you don't have a helmet, we'll be happy to lend you one.
- **Be visible**. Our e-bikes have integrated lights, but we also recommend wearing
  light-colored or reflective clothing.
- **Watch for cars**. If you ride in the bike lane, watch for opening car doors and
  drivers making right turns. Virginia law allows cyclists to ride in the road. You can
  also borrow a [bike horn](https://us.hornit.com/products/v3-db140) to get drivers'
  attention.
- **Start slow**. If you're not used to riding an e-bike, take some time to get used to
  the pedal assist, throttle, gear shift, and brakes in a safe place before venturing to
  busier or faster roads.
- **Do a
  [safety check](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/pre-ride-inspection.html)**. We
  check each e-bike before lending it out, but we recommend squeezing the brake levers to
  check the brakes before each ride.
- **Follow charging instructions**. Charge e-bike batteries as directed, and don't
  overcharge or charge batteries unattended.
- **Stick to paved paths**. Our e-bikes are meant for riding on paved roads. We don't
  recommend taking our bikes off-road, but if you do, ride cautiously. Be sure to allow
  extra braking distance if you ride during or after rain, and don't ride on wet leaves.
